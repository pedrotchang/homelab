# Welcome to my Home(lab) 🏡

<https://www.pedrotchang.dev/>

## Introduction

Here you will find all the documentation of my homelab.

This repository is where I do all my testing, tinkering, and all-in-all a space for me to play, and work! It does have a serious note as well, since I will be working with my own personal data and require me to think about the whole process of deployment and maintanence!

## Hardware & Cluster Provisioning

I like to start off talking about hardware first. It's I think a great base line to understand what I was working with.

I have currently 3 old hardware:\
HP EliteDesk 800 G2 i5-6500T/16GB/256SSD\
HP EliteDesk 800 G2 i5-6500T/16GB/256SSD\
HP Laptop (atm do not know the model) 8GB/256SSD

I love [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/). It has production grade security out of the box, is lightweight, and has robust features. At first, I used straight baremetal. But after sometime (a week...), I realized that [Omni](https://www.siderolabs.com/platform/saas-for-kubernetes/) was the way to go.

I could spin up new clusters in seconds, and exposing external services is a breeze.

I have them in this structure:

| Cluster | Usage | Hardware |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Data | PostgreSQL Database | HP Laptop |
| Tachtit | Apps | HP 800 G2 x 2 |

## Next Steps

- [x] Link my PostgreSQL Database in the data cluster to my TrueNAS Scale.
- [x] Have blob storage for my data cluster to create periodic backups.
- [x] Add on Immich, CommaFeed, Wallabag, to work with my data cluster, and also backup to blob storage.
