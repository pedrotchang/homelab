I am a big proponent to giving credit where it is due, and I would first like to take the time to thank Mischa van den Burg
and the Kubecraft community.

If you have ever been curious about Cloud Native Techlogies, DevOps or Kubernetes, then the place you want to be is in Kubecraft!

## Hardware

I like to start off talking about hardware first. It's I think a great base line to understand what I was working with.

I have currently 3 old hardware:
HP EliteDesk 800 G2 i5-6500T/16GB/256SSD x 2
HP Laptop (atm do not know the model) 8GB/256SSD

At this moment, 2 of these are in play, and they are as follows:

| Cluster | Usage | Hardware |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Data | PostgreSQL Database | HP Laptop |
| Tachtit | Apps | HP 800 G2 |
| ~~Redacted~~ | Private Apps | HP 800 G2 |

I am also utilizing an external backup
